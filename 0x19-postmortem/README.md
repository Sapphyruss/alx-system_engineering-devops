POSTMORTEM REPORT
Service disruption - slow response on the web app


Summary:
Duration: 4 hours
Start Time: January 20, 2024, 08:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: January 20, 2024, 12:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: Degraded performance and intermittent service disruptions for the web application. Approximately 30% of users experienced slow response times and intermittent errors.


Timeline:
11:03 AM: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating increased response times.
11:10 AM: Engineering team initiated investigation, suspecting potential database overload.
11:30 AM: Initial assumption proved incorrect; focus shifted to network infrastructure.
11:50 AM: Escalated incident to network specialists for further analysis.
12:30 PM: Misleading path pursued regarding potential DDoS attack; no evidence found.
01:00 PM: Incident escalated to senior DevOps and database teams for comprehensive investigation.
01:30 PM: Root cause identified as a misconfigured load balancer affecting routing to backend servers.
03:00 PM: Issue resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer and validating proper server routing.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The load balancer's misconfiguration resulted in uneven distribution of incoming requests, causing performance degradation and intermittent errors.
Resolution: The misconfiguration was corrected by adjusting the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers. Additionally, monitoring rules were refined to detect similar issues promptly.



Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Load Balancer Configuration Review: Regularly audit and review load balancer configurations to ensure optimal performance and avoid misconfigurations.
Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring for load balancer metrics, specifically focusing on traffic distribution and server response times.
Documentation Update: Update documentation to include clear guidelines for load balancer configurations, minimizing the risk of misconfigurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Load Balancer Audit: Conduct an immediate audit of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
Monitoring Enhancements: Extend monitoring capabilities to include load balancer-specific metrics and set up automated alerts for unusual patterns.
Team Training: Provide additional training to the operations team on load balancer best practices and troubleshooting techniques.
Communication Protocol: Establish a clear communication protocol for incident escalation, ensuring a more efficient response and collaboration between teams.
Conclusion: 
This outage served as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of regular configuration reviews and robust monitoring. The corrective measures implemented aim to prevent similar incidents in the future, ensuring a more resilient and responsive web application. Continuous improvement in infrastructure management and proactive identification of potential issues will remain a priority to deliver a seamless user experience.
